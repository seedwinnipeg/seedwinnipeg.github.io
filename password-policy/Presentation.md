# Why does cybersecurity matter?

::: notes
- Communicate in binary today.
- 1 = Yes; 0 = No.
- Who will use a computer today?
- Who will deal with confidential information today?
- Cybersecurity is necessary for us to do our work.
- We are entrusted with data from about 25,000 people.
- We are responsible to keep this data private and confidential.
- Much of this data lives in the cloud (Office 365, Google Suite, Better Outcomes) or is accessible via the internet (via VPN)

## What makes a password strong?{data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

## A strong password is *unique.*{data-transition="fade"}
 
> - Don't share your passwords with others
> - Don't reuse a password for more than one account
> - Don't use the same passwords for personal and work accounts

## A strong password is *long.*{data-transition="fade"}

> - A strong password is at least 8 characters long
> - Longer passwords are stronger than shorter ones
> - We recommend 12 characters or longer
> - Note: Some sites limit you to 16 characters or fewer

## A strong password is *uncommon*...{data-transition="fade"}
 
> - Many passwords are easily guessed.
> - The things that are easiest for you to remember (addresses, birth dates, names, etc.) are the easiest for others to guess.
> - Many people use the same formulas and common words to create their passwords (for example: seasons).
> - Uncommon words are harder to guess.

## A strong password is *complex*...{data-transition="fade"}
 
> - A strong password includes characters from at least 3 of the following categories:
>     - Lowercase letters
>     - Uppercase letters
>     - Numbers
>     - Symbols (~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?) 

## A password manager can help you {.center}

## A good password manager should...

> - Be secured with a strong password
> - Generate and remember strong passwords for you
> - Require multi-factor authentication to access

# What is Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)?
