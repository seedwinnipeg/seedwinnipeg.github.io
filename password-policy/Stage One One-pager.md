# What's happening?
- Clear Concepts will implement a new password policy for SEED on the afternoon of Thursday, September 19th.
- Staff will need to change passwords to meet SEED's new password policy.
- We will also setup [Multi Factor Authentication](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-2-step-verification-for-office-365-ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to protect our accounts. This is also known as Two-step verification. To log on to your Office 365 account you will need to have two factors: something you know (your password) and something you have (for example, your cell phone).
- We will start using Single Sign-on. This means you will use the same password for your network login (e.g., schachterk) and Office 365 account (e.g., kevin@seedwinnipeg.ca). When you change your network password, your Office 365 password will be updated automatically. 

# What do I need to do?
1. Think of a new password that meets our password requirements. Your password should:
    - be at least 8 characters long (the longer the better)
    - have 3 of the following character types: uppercase letters; lowercase letters; numbers; and symbols.
    - be unique (different from any other password you use)
    - be uncommon (not easily guessable based on information about you or SEED, and not on the most common password lists)
    - be secret (don't share it with anyone)
2. You will be prompted to create a new password the next time you login to your computer after Thursday afternoon. Enter your new password when you are prompted to do so.
3. Enter your new password into Outlook on your computer.
4. Enter your new password in other places as needed (for example, your cell phone, your web browser, your home computer).
5. Let Kevin know when you are ready to setup Multi Factor Authentication on your cell phone. If you do not have a cell phone or do not want to use your cell phone for Multi Factor Authentication, Kevin will offer other options.

# What if I need help?
- Call or email Clear Concepts or ask Kevin.
- If you forget your new password, Clear Concepts or Kevin can reset it for you.
