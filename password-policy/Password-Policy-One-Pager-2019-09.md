title: What's the Password?
subtitle: Key information about SEED's new password policy
---

# What's happening?
- Clear Concepts will implement a new password policy for us Thursday, September 19th.
- All staff will need to change passwords. You will be prompted to create a new password the next time you login after Thursday afternoon.
- We will start using [Single Sign-on]{custom-style="Accent"}. This means you will use the same password for your network login (e.g., schachterk) and Office 365 account (e.g., kevin@seedwinnipeg.ca). When you change your network password, your Office 365 password will be updated automatically.
- We will also setup [Multi Factor Authentication](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-2-step-verification-for-office-365-ace1d096-61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to protect our accounts. This is also known as [Two-step verification]{custom-style="Accent"}. To log on to your Office 365 account you will need to have two factors: [something you know]{custom-style="Accent"} (your password) and [something you have]{custom-style="Accent"} (e.g., your cell phone).


# What do I need to do?
1. Think of a new password that meets our password requirements. Your password should:
    - be [long]{custom-style="Accent"} (at least 8 characters, and longer is better)
    - be [complex]{custom-style="Accent"} and include at least 3 of the following character types: uppercase letters; lowercase letters; numbers; and symbols (~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?)
    - be [unique]{custom-style="Accent"} (different from any other password you use)
    - be [uncommon]{custom-style="Accent"} (not easy to guess based on information about you, SEED, or common password lists)
    - be [memorable]{custom-style="Accent"} (so you don't forget it)
    - be a [secret]{custom-style="Accent"} (don't share it with anyone)
2. Enter your new password twice when you are prompted to do so after logging in.
3. Enter your new password into Outlook and other places as needed (e.g., your cell phone, your home computer).
5. Let Kevin know when you are ready to setup Multi Factor Authentication on your cell phone. If you do not have a cell phone or do not want to use your cell phone, see Kevin for other options.
